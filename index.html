            <h2><a name="_About_the_drug" id="_About_the_drug"></a>About the Drug Facts table</h2>
            <p>The Drug Facts table shows important information on the label of non-prescription drugs, sometimes called
                over-the-counter medicines. It helps you make an informed decision when buying a drug product by
                allowing you to find and compare information quickly and easily.</p>
            <p>Non-prescription drugs include all items with medicinal ingredients that you can easily purchase without
                a prescription. For example, these include everything from wart creams to pain relievers that you can
                find in a pharmacy or many other stores.</p>
            <p>Some labels already contain a Drugs Facts table. Companies have until <strong>June 30, 2021</strong> to
                fully switch over to the new label requirements. Therefore, you will gradually start to see Drug Facts
                tables on more non-prescription drugs as we near 2021.</p>
            <p>The Drug Facts table is modelled on the <a
                    href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/understanding-food-labels/nutrition-facts-tables.html">Nutrition

                possible warnings.
            </p>
            <h3>Natural health products</h3>
            <p>Manufacturers of natural health products like vitamins are encouraged to include a <a

            <p>The Drug Facts table is in the same order for all non-prescription medications to ensure that you can

            <p>The simple format of the table will help you easily find:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the amount in each dosage unit, which can help avoid the risk of an accidental overdose by

                The image is an example of a drug facts table that you would find on the label of the drug guaifenesin.
                The first section has the title "Drug Facts." In the second section there is "Active ingredient (in each
                5 ml)" is guaifenesin 100mg followed by "Purpose" which is "cough expectorant". The third section lists
                "Uses" which are "relief of wet cough or chest congestion due to common colds", and "helps loosen phlegm
                or mucus and thin lung secretions." The fourth section is "Warnings" which contains subsections. After
                the subheading "Do not use" it reads "with other cough and cold medications unless recommended by a
                doctor or pharmacist". After the subheading "Ask a doctor or pharmacist before use if you" is "have"
                "trouble breathing", "a persistent cough that has not gone away", "asthma or other chronic lung
                conditions", "are pregnant or breastfeeding". After the subheading "Stop use and ask a doctor if" is
                "symptoms get worse or last for more than 1 week", "you have a high fever greater than 38 degrees
                Celsius or headache that does not go away", "you cough up thick yellow or green mucus", "you develop a
                rash". After the subheading "Keep out of the reach of children" is, "in case of an overdose, call poison
                control centre or get medical help right away". The fifth section is "Directions" which specify "adults
                and children 12 years of age and older take 10 to 20 millilitres every 6 hours", and "do not take more
                than 80 millilitres in 24 hours". The sixth section is "Other information" and says "store at room
                temperature, 15 to 30 degrees Celsius". The seventh section is "Inactive ingredients" and says "all
                inactive ingredients are listed here". The last section is "Questions" and there is "call" and a
                placeholder for a one eight hundred number.

                        <p>Under the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/topics/self-care-products.html">self-care
                            framework,</a> Health Canada is looking to update its
                            approach to regulating self-care products such as cosmetics, natural health products and
                            non-prescription drugs. Phase II of the framework will introduce, for consultation, targeted
                            amendments to the Food and Drug Regulations to introduce a risk-based approach to regulatory
                            oversight for non-prescription drugs. These changes are intended to align the oversight for
                            non-prescription drugs with other self-care products of comparable level of risk.
                            For low-risk, cosmetic-like products, a Drug Facts table will be voluntary. For information regarding
